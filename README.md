# Welcome to Student Management App

A full-stack web application for managing student records, built with Spring Boot and deployed on AWS. This was my final project for the Level 6 Advanced Software Development course.

Built using HTML, CSS for Frontend, Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, AWS EC2/RDS, Nginx, SSL, Maven, Git, and IntelliJ IDEA for Backend to represent my final college project. 
Features include CRUD operations, user authentication. Engineered the web application to AWS EC2 with a MySQL database hosted on AWS RDS.

**Live Demo:** [https://studentapp.academy/](https://studentapp.academy/)

## Features

* **Secure User Authentication:** Users can log in to access the application.
* **CRUD Functionality:** Easily Create, Read, Update, and Delete student records from the database.
* **Dynamic Data Tables:** View all students in a clear, sortable table.
* **Search Functionality:** Quickly find specific students by name or other criteria.

## Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Maven
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Thymeleaf
* **Database:** MySQL (Hosted on AWS RDS)
* **Deployment:** AWS EC2, Nginx, SSL (Let's Encrypt)
* **Version Control:** Git / GitHub

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

"A key challenge was integrating the Thymeleaf front-end with the Spring Boot back-end, particularly in passing data from HTML forms to my Java controllers. I overcame this by systematically studying Thymeleaf's attribute syntax to understand how it binds data to Java objects. This was a breakthrough, allowing me to master the use of the @ModelAttribute annotation to handle form submissions cleanly and efficiently."
